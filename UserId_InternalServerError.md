# Error Resolved: 500 Internal Server Error during User Creation

## Issue:
Previously, user creation resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error due to a lack of validation and error handling when attempting to create a user with an existing email ID.

## Solution:
To address this, we introduced validation for email IDs and implemented error handling to provide appropriate feedback when attempting to create a user with an existing email address.

>>> existing_email = await UserService.get_by_email(db, user.email)
    if existing_email:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, detail="Email ID already exists")
